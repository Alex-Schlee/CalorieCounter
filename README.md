# CalorieCounter
Calorie Counter App

My second post graduate adroid app. Another attempt to create a tool to assist in leading a healthy lifestyle.

This app first started out with a simple UI using a SQLite database to store the daily caloric metrics. 
This reached a completed state and I decided to refactor it to MVVM with a Room database. The conversion proved to be more challenging that I initiall thought it would be but I was able to complete the conversion.

In its current state, the user can input a set about of Calories, Carbs, Proteins and Fats. The app will store that info for each day and display the totals. Nothing too crazy. 

Things I Learned:

  UI design is difficult. Its easy to come up with an aesthetically pleasing design in your head but putting it in code is easier said than done. 
  
  "Ready, Fire, Aim" does not work well in software development. In this project I felt that I was made too many things up as I went along. Even having only a rough idea of how a
    project should be structured and how the part fit together will save a lot of future headache.
